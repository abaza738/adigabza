This repository is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault to track my progress of learning the [Circassian Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_languages) in the [Kabardian Dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabardian_language).

## Method
I am using [Optilingo](https://www.optilingo.com/) by [Jonty Yamisha](https://yamisha.com/).
